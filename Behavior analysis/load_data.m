function data = load_data(experiment)
    
    % Load data from csv files.
    %
    % USAGE: data = load_data(experiment)
    %
    % INPUTS:
    %   experiment - which experiment data to load (1 or 2)
    %
    % Data:
    % Each csv file contains data for a single experiment.
    % - data1.csv is a bandit task with one stochastic arm and one deterministic arm
    % - data2.csv is a bandit task with two stochastic arms
    %
    % Columns in each csv file:
    % 1) subject #
    % 2) block #
    % 3) trial #
    % 4) mu1 (mean reward for arm 1)
    % 5) mu2 (mean reward for arm 2)
    % 6) choice (which arm was selected)
    % 7) reward (points)
    % 8) response time (milliseconds)
    %
    % OUTPUTS:
    % data - structure with the following fields:
    %   .N - # of trials
    %   .C - # of options
    %   .R - [N x 2] mean rewards for each arm (or in the case of PEIRS
    %   data the available choices on the trial)
    %   .block - [N x 1] block #
    %   .trial - [N x 1] trial #
    %   .c - [N x 1] choice
    %   .rt - [N x 1] response time
